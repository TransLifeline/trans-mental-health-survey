      p.
        Transgender people face incredible obstacles in many aspects of life, chief
        among them is accessing affordable, affirming, and competent healthcare.
        #[a(href='http://www.thetaskforce.org/') The National LGBTQ Task Force] and
        #[a(href='http://www.translifeline.org/') Trans Lifeline] are joining forces to help
        identify the unique barriers that transgender people face in accessing mental
        health care by conducting the most comprehensive survey of mental health in
        the transgender community. The surveyâ€™s ultimate goal is to collect data that
        informs mental health practitioners so that they can develop policies that
        improve support systems for this vulnerable population.
